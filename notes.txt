Testing Setup:

1) Test Runner :-> Execute your tests, summarize results i.e. Mocha (unit + inteigration )
2) Assertion Library :-> Define testing logic, conditions i.e. Chai (unit + inteigration )

Both i.e. Test Runner + Assertion -> i.e. Jest

3) Headless Browser :-> Simulates Browser interaction i.e. Puppeteer (e2e)

Setup:

npm install --save-dev jest


---Unit Testing---
Unit testing is type of testing to check if the small piece of code is doing what it is suppose to do.
i.e. check single component of an application
i.e. have no dependencies on code outside the unit testd 
i.e. mainly focus on the testing the functionality of individual units only and does not uncover the
    issues arises when different modules are interacting with each other.
i.e. The goal of Unit testing is to test the each unit separately and ensure that each unit is working as expected.	
i.e. White box testing type

---Integration Testing---
Integration testing is a type of testing to check if different piece of the modules are workign together.
i.e.  behavior of integration modules is considered in the Integration testing.
i.e. dependent on other outside systems like databases, hardware allocated for them etc.
i.e. to be carried out to discover the the issues arise when different modules are interacting with
    each other to build overall system.
i.e. The goal of Integration testing is to test the combined modules together and ensure that every combined modules
    are working as expected.
i.e. both Black box and White box type of testing.
